==================================


Three channels:

Bootstrap:
  - static message containing inode location (message id) for root directory

inodes:
- implemented as a pickled file
  Two types:
    - directory inodes
      - file counter
      - stores 2048 blocks for files (2048 files per directory)
      - stores 2048 blocks for directories (2048 children)

    - file inodes
      - stores filename
      - stores file size
      - block counter
      - stores message ids for the first 2048 blocks (2048 * 5 MB = ~5 GB)
      - indirect blocks?
      - stores message id of inode of parent directory

files:
  Stores file data, each of 5 MB blocks

===== Overview =======
 - OS agnostic filestore
 - should be run on a local machine in order to do local machine downloads and such, but all the data should be stored online
 - anyone using this should be able to run from their computer and be immediately bootstrapped into the filesystem

==== User API =======
Local machine instructions:
  - ls -> sees the ENTIRE filetree
  - inspect -> sees files in the current directory
  - cd 
  - pwd
  - mkdir
  - up [path] - uploads a file to a path
  - dl [file] - downloads a file in the current directory

discord instructions:
  - ls -> sees entire filetree
  - cd
  - pwd
  - mkdir
  - touch -> creates an empty file in the current directory


==== Implementation ====
upon loading, load all directory inodes into memory for ls purposes

1. Create bootstrapping
2. create the file upload mechanic
3. create file download mechanic
4. create directories
