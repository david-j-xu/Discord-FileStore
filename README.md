# Discord FileStore

## Overview

Online cloud storage is a popular way for people to share, backup, and store files, both in the short and long term. However, all cloud storage solutions currently require that people pay, usually in the form of a subscription, for the option to store unlimited data. Discord, on the other hand, allows for unlimited storage of messages, including files. As such, we can leverage this in order to create a filesystem.
